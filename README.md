# KeyNote

KeyNote is a content and curriculum management web app. This web app is made in an attempt to simplify the needs of a basic college/school going student with displaying the modules, it's topics, relevent downloadable course resources and other YouTube Video lectures all embedded into one page.

*Note: This repository only contains the design prototype of the webapp.*

These are some snapshots of the overall look of the app.
